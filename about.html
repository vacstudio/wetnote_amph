    <h1 class="title has-text-white">About WetNote Amphora Catalogue</h1>
    <p>
      WetNote is a growing digital platform designed to support divers, archaeologists,
      researchers, and conservation teams working in the aquatic world. The project begins
      with a specialized focus: an advanced <strong>Amphora Typology Catalogue</strong> built
      to help users explore, compare, and understand ancient amphoras using structured data,
      drawings, images, and 3D models.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-white mt-5">Why This Catalogue?</h2>
    <p>
      Amphoras are key to understanding ancient trade, production, and maritime activity.
      However, identifying them is often slow and requires years of typological familiarity.
      This catalogue aims to simplify that process by providing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ A structured typology browser with detailed filters</li>
      <li>✔ Drawings, photographs, and SVG silhouettes</li>
      <li>✔ Interactive 3D models for visual comparison</li>
      <li>✔ Metadata and measurements linked to archaeological sources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-white mt-5">Beyond Amphoras: A Platform for Aquatic Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Although our journey begins with amphora typology, WetNote is designed to grow into a
      wider project-management ecosystem for underwater work. In the future, the platform will
      support tools for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>• Cave survey and mapping projects</li>
      <li>• Ghost-net and marine debris documentation</li>
      <li>• Conservation monitoring</li>
      <li>• Maritime archaeology fieldwork</li>
      <li>• Photogrammetry processing and dataset management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each module will be designed to help field teams collect, organize, analyze, and share
      their expedition data from a single unified platform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-white mt-5">What Is AmphorAI?</h2>
    <p>
      AmphorAI is an upcoming feature that will use image analysis and machine learning to help
      users quickly identify amphoras from photos. It will compare the uploaded image against
      the models in our dataset and return the closest typological matches. AmphorAI is still
      in development but represents the future direction of the platform—combining traditional
      archaeology with modern computational tools.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-white mt-5">About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      WetNote Amphora Catalogue is developed by <strong>Nevcan Uludaş</strong> as part of an
      academic project in underwater archaeology. With over a decade of expertise in scientific
      diving, underwater documentation, and exploration projects, the platform is built upon
      both field experience and digital innovation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-white mt-5">Credits & Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
      The project acknowledges the contribution of open-access archaeological datasets,
      academic research, and 3D repositories that support cultural heritage preservation.
      We continue to invite volunteers and specialists who wish to refine typologies,
      expand datasets, or collaborate on digital heritage tools.
    </p>
